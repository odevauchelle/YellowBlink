# Name:         Shutdown Daemon
#
# Purpose:      This program gets activated at the end of the boot process by
#               cron. (@ reboot sudo python /home/pi/shutdown_daemon.py)
#               It monitors a button press. If the user presses the button, we
#               Halt the Pi, by executing the poweroff command.
#
#               The power to the Pi will then be cut when the Pi has reached the
#               poweroff state (Halt).
#               To activate a gpio pin with the poweroff state, the
#               /boot/config.txt file needs to have :
#               dtoverlay=gpio-poweroff,gpiopin=27
